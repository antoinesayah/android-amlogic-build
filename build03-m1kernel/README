Build Steps: 
=============
See "syncover" for the directories and files.

[1] Download toolchain, kernel source, and build system. 
[2] Extract the files.
[3] Patch the files under kernel directory to contain files in this project. 
    The patch should contain changes from tag bld001-xstamp0 till HEAD.
    The tag bld002 adds copy of test34 source files by simply copying reff34-1 files. 
    Later tags adds modifications to the source and scripts. 

[4] Use "cd arm_ref/m1-kernel-android" to go into kernel directory.
[5] Run "source env.sh" to set environment variables.

[6] Run "./k1ocfg.sh" to apply the saved configuration. 
[7] Run "./k2mcfg.sh" if any kernel configuration is to be changed manually.
[8] Run ".k3bld.sh" to build the uImage. 



Boot into the built kernel using a SD card:
==============================================

Refer to this forum page: 
 http://www.freaktab.com/showthread.php?3029-WAIT!-New-Nexbook-AMlogic-root-idea!/page4

Download the file mentioned in the forum page here: 
 https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B9BFwCzfMWZ8S2tCemEyZ2lZM2M/edit

Then follow the instructions from the forum page: 

 1) erase and format your SDcard so you know you have a nice clean one.
 2) Unzip this download package and put ALL the files on the root of your SDcard.

    aml_autoscript
    update_root_ext3.zip
    uImage_cwm
    uImage

 2.5) modification:
    Now delete the original "uImage_cwm" and "uImage". 
    Copy your built uImage kernel into the SD card and rename it "uImage_cwm". 
    Also delete the file "update_root_ext3.zip" as step 4,5,6) below not working yet.
    Note that step 3) uses normal power-up procedure, i.e. hold power button for 3 seconds. 

 3) Boot into recovery using the buttons DO NOT use the APP from the OS.

 The below steps does not apply as the "update_root_ext3.zip" does not work yet. 
 
 4) In recovery use menu apply update from sdcard and select the update_root_ext3.zip
 5) Watch for errors when it is apllying package and let me know if you get any.
 6) reboot using recovery menu.


Alternatively, rename uImage to "uImage_recovery" and hold volume-down and power button, 
it also boots into the "uImage_recovery" from SD card. See page 14 on the forum topic.
